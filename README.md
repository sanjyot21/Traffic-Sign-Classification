# Traffic-Sign-Classification
This project is a real-time traffic sign recognition system that utilizes computer vision techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) implemented with OpenCV and Python.

## Features
* Real-time Traffic Sign Recognition
* User-friendly interface for adding and removing individuals
* Build a GUI using Tkinter - upload test image 

## Requirements
* A computer with a webcam
* A stable internet connection
* Python 3.x and a virtual environment setup
* Python 3.6+
* OpenCV 4.0+
* Tensorflow 2.0+
* Numpy

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which consists of 50,000+ traffic sign images with 43 classes.
The dataset can be downloaded from link below and should be placed in the data directory.
